A "Supnick matrix" or "Supnick array" &ndash; named after Fred Supnick of the City College of New York, who introduced the notion in 1957 &ndash; is a Monge array which is also a symmetric matrix.

== Mathematical definition ==

A Supnick matrix is a square Monge array that is symmetric around the main diagonal.

An "n"-by-"n" matrix is a Supnick matrix if, for all "i", "j", "k", "l" such that if
:<math>1\le i < k\le n</math> and <math>1\le j < l\le n</math>
then
:<math>a_{ij} + a_{kl} \le a_{il} + a_{kj}\,</math>

and also

:<math>a_{ij} = a_{ji}. \,</math>

A logically equivalent definition is given by Rudolf & Woeginger who in 1995 proved that

:"A matrix is a Supnick matrix iff it can be written as the sum of a sum matrix "S" and a non-negative linear combination of LL-UR block matrices."

The "sum matrix" is defined in terms of a sequence of "n" real numbers {a<sub>"i"</sub>}:

:<math>
S = [s_{ij}] = [\alpha_i + \alpha_j]; \,
</math>

and an "LL-UR block matrix" consists of two symmetrically placed rectangles in the lower-left and upper right corners for which "a<sub>ij</sub>"&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, with all the rest of the matrix elements equal to zero.

== Properties ==

Adding two Supnick matrices together will result in a new Supnick matrix (Deineko and Woeginger 2006).

Multiplying a Supnick matrix by a non-negative real number produces a new Supnick matrix (Deineko and Woeginger 2006).

If the distance matrix in a traveling salesman problem can be written as a Supnick matrix, that particular instance of the problem admits an easy solution (even though the problem is, in general, NP hard).
