"METIS" is a software package for graph partitioning that implements various multilevel algorithms. METIS' multilevel approach has three phases and comes with several algorithms for each phase:
# Coarsen the graph by generating a sequence of graphs G<sub>0</sub>, G<sub>1</sub>, ..., G<sub>N</sub>, where G<sub>0</sub> is the original graph and for each 0 = i = j = N, the number of vertices in G<sub>i</sub> is greater than the number of vertices in G<sub>j</sub>.
# Compute a partition of G<sub>N</sub>
# Project the partition back through the sequence in the order of G<sub>N</sub>, ..., G<sub>0</sub>, refining it with respect to each graph.
The final partition computed during the third phase (the refined partition projected onto G<sub>0</sub>) is a partition of the original graph.
