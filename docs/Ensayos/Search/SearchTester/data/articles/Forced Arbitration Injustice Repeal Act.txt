== Background ==
Forced arbitration clauses are commonly found in contracts between individuals and businesses. In cases where individuals bring legal claims against their employer or a business, forced arbitration generally prohibits them from the choice of taking such claims to be heard in court and instead to closed-door arbitration proceedings, where they are less likely to receive an impartial hearing.

Some employers have removed provisions from contracts subjecting their employees to forced arbitration amid public pressure regarding concerns that the practice inhibits the rights of workers to hold their employer accountable for allegations of sexual harassment, discrimination, and wage theft. In November of 2018, over 20,000 employees of the technology giant Google organized a walkout protest against the company in response to Google’s policies around “equity and transparency in the workplace,” which includes forced arbitration in worker contracts. In February 2019, Google announced they were ending their policy of forced arbitration for full-time employees.
