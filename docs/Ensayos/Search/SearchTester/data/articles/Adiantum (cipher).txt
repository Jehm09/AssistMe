"Adiantum" is a cipher construction for disk encryption, which uses the ChaCha and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) ciphers, and Poly1305 cryptographic message authentication code (MAC).

It was designed in 2018 by Paul Crowley and Eric Biggers at Google specifically for low-powered mobile devices running Android Go. It's available in the Linux kernel since version 5.0. 
"HPolyC" is an earlier variant of Adiantum, which uses a different construction for the Poly1305 hash function.

The HBSH construction consists of hash, block cipher, stream cipher, hash.
