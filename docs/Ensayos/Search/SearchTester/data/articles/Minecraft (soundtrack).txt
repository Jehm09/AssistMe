The soundtrack of the 2011 Mojang video game "Minecraft" was composed by German musician Daniel Rosenfeld, better known as C418. The game's soundtrack is instrumental ambient music, and has been praised by critics. In 2011, the video game blog Kotaku chose the soundtrack as one of the best video game soundtracks of that year. "Minecraft"'s soundtrack was released across two soundtrack albums, "Minecraft – Volume Alpha" (2011), and "Minecraft – Volume Beta" (2013). Both albums include music featured in the game, as well as other music included in trailers, and instrumentals that were not included in the game's final release. In 2017, Rosenfeld confirmed the future release, claiming "[the album] is still far from done".

In a panel at MineCon in 2012, Rosenfeld stated that he has had a long-term interest in video games, and was involved with several video game communities.

The soundtrack's minimalistic and melancholic composition has been praised by critics. In 2018, The Boar described the soundtrack's composition as "nostalgia in its purest form".
