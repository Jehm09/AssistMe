The "Abangan" are Javanese people who are Muslims who practice a much more syncretic version of Islam than the more orthodox santri. The term, apparently derived from the Javanese language word for red, "abang", was first developed by Clifford Geertz, but the meaning has since shifted. "Abangan" are more inclined to follow a local system of beliefs called adat and Kebatinan than pure Sharia (Islamic law). Their belief system integrates Hinduism, Buddhism and animism. However, some scholars hold that what has classically been viewed as Indonesian variance from Islam is often a part of that faith in other countries. For example, Martin van Bruinessen notes similarity between "adat" and historical practice among Muslims in Egypt as described by Edward Lane.
