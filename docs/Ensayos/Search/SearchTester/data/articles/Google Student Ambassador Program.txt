The "Google Student Ambassador Program" was a global program that was aimed at active tertiary students from all academic backgrounds. It was an opportunity for students to act as liaisons between Google and their universities and also an opportunity for Google to contribute to the education of future leaders.

== History ==
The program selected campus leaders from the Bachelors and Masters levels, it was an opportunity for these students to improve their soft skills, to develop their professional capabilities and to collaborate with other exciting and intelligent people across the continent.

The program was discontinued in 2016, as Google argued that it was not as a result of impact but a need to address changing global educational needs.
