=== At Google ===
During the Summer of 2011, Music Beta by Google was hosting a series of concerts at the Googleplex. The second in the series of concerts was opened by jazz artist Meklit Hadero and headlined by Matt Nathanson.

Throughout the show Nathanson made jabs at both audience members and even Facebook. One notable instance was while Nathanson was preparing the audience for a sing-a-long, he called attention to an audience member on his laptop when he said, "You're in the front, you're on your computer, but I know what you're doing is looking up the lyrics. You don't have to look up the lyrics, because this is totally easy. 'Hee,' 'hee,' 'who.' It's - and I feel it, I felt you wanting to sing."
