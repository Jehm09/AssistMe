"Pimp My Search" was a novelty website to create a Google lookalike webpage, replacing the word "Google" with a word or phrase of the user's choice. It is a non-commercial website and is not connected to Google, Inc. Pimp My Search was started in 2006, but became popular only in 2008 after featured in many media websites and YouTube videos. The site was closed down later in 2009, citing a dispute over 'trademark issues'.
