In computer science and statistics, the "Jaro–Winkler distance" is a string metric measuring an edit distance between two sequences. It is a variant proposed in 1990 by William E. Winkler of the "Jaro distance" metric (1989, Matthew A. Jaro).

The Jaro–Winkler distance uses a prefix scale <math>p</math> which gives more favourable ratings to strings that match from the beginning for a set prefix length <math>\ell</math>. 

The lower the Jaro–Winkler distance for two strings is, the more similar the strings are. The score is normalized such that 1 equates to no similarity and 0 is an exact match. The "Jaro–Winkler similarity" is given by 1 - Jaro–Winkler distance.

Although often referred to as a "distance metric", the Jaro–Winkler distance is not a metric in the mathematical sense of that term because it does not obey the triangle inequality.

== Definition ==

=== Jaro Similarity ===
The Jaro Similarity <math>sim_j</math> of two given strings <math>s_1</math> and <math>s_2</math> is

: <math>sim_j = \left\{

\begin{array}{l l}
  0 & \text{if }m = 0\\
  \frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{m} + \frac{m} + \frac{m-t}{m}\right) & \text{otherwise} \end{array} \right.</math>

Where:

* <math>|s_i|</math> is the length of the string <math>s_i</math>;
* <math>m</math> is the number of "matching characters" (see below);
* <math>t</math> is half the number of "transpositions" (see below).

Two characters from <math>s_1</math> and <math>s_2</math> respectively, are considered "matching" only if they are the same and not farther than <math>\left\lfloor\frac{\max(|s_1|,|s_2|)}{2}\right\rfloor-1</math>.

Each character of <math>s_1</math> is compared with all its matching characters in <math>s_2</math>. The number of matching (but different sequence order) characters divided by 2 defines the number of "transpositions".
For example, in comparing CRATE with TRACE, only 'R'   'A'   'E'  are the matching characters, i.e. m=3. Although 'C', 'T' appear in both strings, they are farther than 1 (the result of <math>\lfloor\tfrac{5}{2}\rfloor - 1</math>).  Therefore, t=0 . In DwAyNE versus DuANE the matching letters are already in the same order D-A-N-E, so no transpositions are needed.

=== Jaro–Winkler Similarity ===
Jaro–Winkler similarity uses a prefix scale <math>p</math> which gives more favorable ratings to strings that match from the beginning for a set prefix length <math>\ell</math>. Given two strings <math>s_1</math> and <math>s_2</math>, their Jaro–Winkler similarity <math>sim_w</math> is:

: <math>sim_w = sim_j + \ell p (1 - sim_j),</math>

where:
* <math>sim_j</math> is the Jaro similarity for strings <math>s_1</math> and <math>s_2</math>
* <math>\ell</math> is the length of common prefix at the start of the string up to a maximum of four characters
* <math>p</math> is a constant scaling factor for how much the score is adjusted upwards for having common prefixes. <math>p</math> should not exceed 0.25, otherwise the similarity could become larger than 1. The standard value for this constant in Winkler's work is <math>p = 0.1</math>

The Jaro-Winkler distance <math>d_w</math> is defined as <math>d_w = 1 - sim_w</math>.

Although often referred to as a "distance metric", the Jaro–Winkler distance is not a metric in the mathematical sense of that term because it does not obey the triangle inequality. The Jaro–Winkler distance also does not satisfy the identity axiom <math> d(x,y)=0 \leftrightarrow x = y</math>.

== Relationship with other edit distance metrics ==
There are other popular measures of edit distance, which are calculated using a different set of allowable edit operations. For instance,
* the Levenshtein distance allows deletion, insertion and substitution;
* the Damerau–Levenshtein distance allows insertion, deletion, substitution, and the transposition of two adjacent characters;
* the longest common subsequence (LCS) distance allows only insertion and deletion, not substitution;
* the Hamming distance allows only substitution, hence, it only applies to strings of the same length.
Edit distance is usually defined as a parameterizable metric calculated with a specific set of allowed edit operations, and each operation is assigned a cost (possibly infinite). This is further generalized by DNA sequence alignment algorithms such as the Smith–Waterman algorithm, which make an operation's cost depend on where it is applied.
