== History ==
Shotbow was formed in February 2012. After an already lengthy and initial success of Hardcore Factions, the first gamemode created by HCGaming LLC, owner/operator Matt Sundberg and Lead Developer Austin Smith contacted close friends and staff of Hardcore Factions to take on creating a unique spin on the popular mod DayZ, which was later aptly named MineZ. After the game's great success and rapid explosion into the Minecraft world the team came together to be the first server to link together a series of games with a centralized hub that didn’t require a disconnect or loading screens. Shotbow was born as the first major server network, forever changing the landscape of the Minecraft multiplayer network.

== Gamemodes ==
