The "Digital News Initiative" is a European organisation created by Google to "support high-quality journalism through technology and innovation". It encompasses an "Innovation Fund" worth €150m, which in 2018 issued grants to 461 projects at news organisations across Europe.

== Goals ==
Google describe the goal of the Initiative as "helping journalism thrive in the digital age".

== Funding Recipients ==
The Initiative's fund donates 88% of its dispensations to western Europe, and 54% to organisations founded before 1997. Prospective recipients are required to demonstrate how they create "economic value added for [their] business". It begins:<blockquote>One of the actions from our DNI WG meeting in Lisbon was about more information about the proposed Copyright Directive. Apologies for the delay on my side and the timing is urgent as there is a vote in the Juri committee [linked] of the European Parliament on June 20th on the Copyright directive.

If you feel strongly about this, then please condsider contacting the MEPs [linked] on the Juri committee.

All the best - Madhav</blockquote> Attached to the letter were a bullet pointed list of Google's opinions on the proposed reforms.

Madhav Chinnappa, author of the email and "Director of News Ecosystem Development" at Google, later stated that the message had been sent in response to a request for comment by members of the working group.
