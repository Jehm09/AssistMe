"Solve for X" is a think tank-like event and community engagement project launched by Google The project kicked off on February 1, 2012 at a three-day convention at CordeValle Resort in San Martin, California. Solve for X talks were presented to 50 people who collaboratively brainstormed to help those pursuing solutions, hosted by Google executives Eric Schmidt, Astro Teller, and Megan Smith who co-created the project. The conventions are expected to occur "a few times a year". The website inaugurated on February 6, 2012.

Solve for X has been likened to TED talks since both projects host seminars by innovators, which can be viewed by others "vicariously" through the projects' respective websites. European director Bruno Giussani stated regarding Google's endeavor: "The world needs more ideas, not fewer and more commitment to sharing them freely and openly so that collectively we can test-run them and turn them into reality ... Google being at the origin of this, obviously technology and engineering will play a big role in Solve For X".
