"Mineplex" is a "Minecraft" game server officially partnered with Mojang. It was founded on January 24, 2013 by two players under the usernames "Sterling_" and "Spu_". However, as Mineplex's popularity has been declining, this number used to be around 10,000. The server's record, 34,434 players on January 28, 2015, is the highest in all of Minecraft and was recognized by Guinness World Records in "Guinness World Records 2016: Gamer's Edition". The amount of unique log-ins on the server is unknown, although it could be well into the millions as implied by the 500,000+ users on the server's forums. They are divided into categories such as Classics, Arcade, Champions, Clans, and Holiday minigames. To pay for the server and its development, Mineplex sells in-game cosmetics and special features to players. In 2016, the Dallas Mavericks partnered with Mineplex to create "Dallas Mavericks World", a minigame for the server. According to a news release by the team, it will allow players to compete in building competitions and play a basketball minigame on a full-scale model of the American Airlines Center. The minigame was launched on the server in the summer of 2016. In "Guinness World Records 2016: Gamers Edition", Mineplex was listed as the most popular Minecraft server network, having 34,434 players on the server at once on January 28, 2015.
