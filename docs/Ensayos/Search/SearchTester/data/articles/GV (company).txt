By 2014, it had invested in companies such as Shape Security. In December 2015, the company was renamed GV and introduced a new logo.

==Services model==
GV was one of the first venture capital firms to employ the venture capital services model. It provides portfolio companies with access to operational help after making a financial investment. Full-time partners at GV work with portfolio companies on design and product management, marketing, engineering, and recruiting.

GV has developed an intensive, five-day design process, called a Design Sprint, which helps startups solve problems quickly.
