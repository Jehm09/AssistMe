"IBM" was a 2009 project using the resources developed in 2007's IBM/Google Cloud Computing partnership. This initiative was to provide access to cloud computing for the universities of all countries.

This initiative was funded by the National Science Foundation awarding $5 million in grants to 14 universities, including Kyushu University, University of Washington, Carnegie Mellon University, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

By 2011, Google and IBM were completing the program since high-performance cloud computing clusters had become widely available to researchers at reasonable costs.
