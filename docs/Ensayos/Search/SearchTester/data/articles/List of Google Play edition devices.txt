The "Google Play edition devices" ("GPE") is a series of consumer mobile devices sanctioned by Google that run the Android operating system. Unlike the standard versions of Android on these devices, which have received "skins" from the original equipment manufacturer, such as Samsung TouchWiz or HTC Sense, they run a "stock" version of Android, without any manufacturer or wireless carrier modifications, making them essentially like Google Nexus and Google Pixel devices in terms of software but they do not carry the Google Nexus branding, nor does their hardware differ from that of the original devices upon which the Play editions are based. Because of this, the software includes slight, under-the-hood changes to function on the original manufacturer's hardware.

These devices are carrier unlocked and GSM-based, and have been offered exclusively through Google's Play Store. Updates for these devices are delivered by Google (bypassing carriers), but are supplied by the original device manufacturer.
Although the updates are not supplied directly by Google, as is the case with the products from the Nexus line, these devices receive Android updates at nearly the same time as Nexus products.

In January 2015, Google stopped selling their final Google Play edition phone. While Google never officially announced the end of the program, no new phones have been announced since. However, stock Android devices are still being made - as of 2017 by companies including Google (Pixel), HMD Global (Nokia) and Lenovo (Motorola).
