"Mayfield Mall" was a shopping mall in Mountain View, California, that operated from the 1960s until 1984. It was the first air-conditioned, enclosed shopping mall in Northern California,

==As a mall==
Mayfield Mall opened in 1966 and was the first enclosed mall of its type in the region, taking its name from the original town of Mayfield, which was annexed by Palo Alto in 1925. Its original anchor was JCPenney, which closed stores on Castro Street and University Avenue to consolidate into the mall location.

The mall did decent business but closed in the face of newer, larger centers such as Valley Fair Mall, Stanford Mall, and Vallco Fashion Park. The JCPenney store moved to the San Antonio Shopping Center, where it would last until the mid-1990s. However, in the early 2000s, HP opted to consolidate into other office spaces, leaving the mall vacant. By 2003, the old mall was on the market after a deal to sell to Stanford Hospital failed over zoning issues. Google is not the only large tech company to buy and renovate a former mall for office use; the headquarters of Rackspace are located at the former Windsor Park Mall near San Antonio, Texas. Three years into the lease deal, Google purchased the entire property outright.
